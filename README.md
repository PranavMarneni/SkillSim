# 🧠 SkillSim: AI-Native Hiring Through Real-World Simulation

**Turning workflows into intelligence. Stimulating real-life skills — not memorized trivia.**

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

**SkillSim** is a next-generation technical hiring platform that evaluates candidates on **real-world tasks**, not abstract puzzles. By simulating actual workflows using internal tools and data — like Jira tickets, GitHub PRs, Slack threads, logs, and day-in-the-life recordings — SkillSim delivers **adaptive, role-specific simulations** to assess:

* Reasoning
* Execution
* Collaboration
* Communication

This results in **more predictive, fair, and job-relevant assessments** — aligned with how modern teams work.

## 💥 The Problem

Hiring for engineering and technical leadership roles is fundamentally broken.

### ❌ Status Quo

| Platform                                   | Limitation                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LeetCode-style tests**                   | Obscure algorithms, irrelevant to real work              |
| **HackerRank / CodeSignal / Codility**     | Better, but lack real-world realism                      |
| **DevSkiller / Vervoe**                    | Limited to static templates; weak soft-skill evaluation  |
| **Karat / Toptal**                         | Human-led, costly, still abstract from real environments |
| **ATS Tools (e.g. TestGorilla, CoderPad)** | Fast but shallow — no depth or realism                   |

### 🤯 New Challenge in the LLM Era

LLMs handle routine tasks. Companies now need humans who can:

* Exercise judgment
* Resolve ambiguity
* Collaborate effectively

**Traditional tests can’t evaluate this.**

## ✅ Our Solution: SkillSim

**SkillSim** assesses modern engineering talent in 3 stages:

### 1. **📥 Data Collection**

* Pulls from: Jira, Slack, codebases, documentation, stakeholder interviews, and workday recordings.

### 2. **🧠 AI Analysis & Simulation Generation**

* Uses LLMs + RAG to extract core skills.
* Matches to test templates.
* Dynamically generates simulations mirroring real job tasks.

### 3. **🧪 Candidate Assessment**

* Candidates complete live, interactive tasks.
* Assessed by LLM-based rubrics + optional human review for:

  * Code quality
  * Communication
  * Decision-making
  * Collaboration & adaptability

> 🔒 **Privacy-first**: All processing stays in the client’s environment. No external data exposure.

## 🧪 Sample Use Case: Hiring a Backend Engineer

### Real Workflow Analysis:

* Debugging flaky integrations
* Managing async Slack discussions
* Writing secure endpoints from vague specs

### Simulated Task Examples:

1. **Log Triage & Jira Response**
2. **Slack Thread Communication**
3. **Secure Endpoint Implementation**
4. **Live PR Feedback to Junior Engineer**
5. **Prompting & Fixing with LLM**
6. **Retrospective Reflection**

> Every simulation is **a realistic job preview** — not a generic coding puzzle.

## 🔍 Inside the Mock Test

| Simulation                | What It Tests                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Drop**          | Product understanding, communication, triage |
| **Code Navigation + Fix** | Debugging, test coverage, speed              |
| **Live PR Review**        | Mentorship, technical judgment, tone         |
| **LLM Collaboration**     | Prompt engineering, validation, adaptation   |
| **Self-Reflection**       | Maturity, growth mindset                     |

## 📊 Results Dashboard (Hiring Team View)

* **Skill Scores** (e.g., Communication: 8.5 / Debugging: 9.2)
* **Behavior Tags** (“collaborative,” “bias to action”)
* **Highlight Reels** (e.g., “Spotted untested edge case”)

## 🏆 Competitive Landscape: Why SkillSim Wins

| Platform       | Weakness                | **SkillSim Advantage**            |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **DevSkiller** | Static, code-only       | Real Slack/Jira/IDE workflows     |
| **Vervoe**     | Generic simulations     | RAG-based company-specific tasks  |
| **Canditech**  | Basic soft-skill AI     | Multimodal, full-cycle simulation |
| **Karat**      | High cost, not scalable | AI + human hybrid at scale        |
| **CodeSignal** | Gamified, unrealistic   | Depth, fit, soft-skill evaluation |
