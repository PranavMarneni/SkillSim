##SkillSim: AI Native Hiring Through Real World Simulation
Turning workflows into intelligence. Stimulating real life skills, not memorized trivia. 

Project Summary:
SkillSim is a next-generation technical hiring platform that evaluates candidates on real-world tasks‚Äînot abstract puzzles‚Äîby simulating the actual workflows they‚Äôll encounter on the job. Drawing from company-specific data like Jira tickets, GitHub PRs, Slack threads, logs, and voluntary workday recordings, SkillSim uses AI and expert input to create adaptive, role-specific assessments. Candidates are measured on reasoning, execution, collaboration, and communication, resulting in a more predictive, fair, and practical evaluation aligned with how modern engineering teams truly work

Problem:
Hiring engineers and technical leaders is broken.
Status Quo:
LeetCode-style questions test obscure algorithms irrelevant to day-to-day work.
HackerRank, Codility, CodeSignal are better but still lack workplace realism.
DevSkiller, Vervoe simulate work tasks but rely on static templates, not live workflows. The level in which they simulate work tasks is limited to a single project based evaluation. Basically a slightly longer traditional coding interview. Their assessment of soft skills is limited to AI analysing video interviews. 
Karat, Toptal offer human-led interviews but are costly and abstract.
ATS tools like TestGorilla, CoderPad prioritize speed over depth.
Hiring managers consistently struggle with:
Evaluating problem-solving under ambiguity.
Assessing communication and team fit.
Predicting performance in real environments.
New Challenge: With LLMs automating routine work, companies need engineers who excel in judgment, ambiguity resolution, and collaboration‚Äîareas traditional tests fail to assess.
Our Solution: SkillSim
SkillSim operates in 3 stages:
Data Collection
Pulls from internal sources: Jira tickets, documentation, codebases, Slack threads, stakeholder interviews, and optionally, day-in-the-life recordings.
AI Analysis & Simulation Generation
Uses LLMs and RAG to extract core responsibilities and skills.
Matches skills with curated test templates.
Dynamically builds interactive simulations mirroring real job tasks.
Candidate Assessment
Candidates complete real-world tasks under simulation.
LLM-based rubrics and human reviewers assess:
Code quality
Communication
Decision-making
Collaboration & adaptability
Privacy & Security:
Models are shipped to client environments.
No internal data is exposed externally.
All processing happens within the company‚Äôs secure infrastructure.

Use Case Example
A manager wants to hire a backend engineer. SkillSim analyzes workflows from a senior engineer:
Debugging flaky third-party integrations
Managing async Slack discussions
Writing secure endpoints under vague specs
Generated Simulation:
Diagnose unclear bug via logs
Respond to a "mid-project" Slack thread
Implement a secure endpoint from incomplete requirements
The Mock Test Experience
To reduce candidate anxiety and increase fairness, SkillSim offers mock simulations ‚Äî full-featured, immersive previews of the real assessment experience.
üß† Candidate Experience (SkillSim Mock Test)
üß™ Simulation Title: "Triage & Ship: A Day in the Life of a SWE at Blank Corp"
üîπ 1. Context Drop (Immersive Onboarding) Prompt: "You've just started your morning as a Backend SWE at Acme Corp. Your first task is to review a Slack thread where a customer success engineer flagged a bug affecting enterprise clients."
You see:
A Slack thread with confused messages from PM and Support
A link to the Jira ticket with incomplete details
A related GitHub PR with test failures
Your Task:
Summarize the root cause in 2‚Äì3 bullet points
Create a response message to send in Slack
Assign ownership and next steps in the Jira ticket
Why this matters: Tests contextual understanding, triaging, communication, and product intuition.
üîπ 2. Code Navigation + Fix Task (Interactive Coding) Prompt: A production bug caused by async DB call order has been introduced. Navigate through a simulated GitHub repo, find the issue, and make a hotfix. Pre-written tests must pass without regressions.
Scoring Dimensions:
Time to locate the issue
Code quality
Correctness of fix
Passing test coverage
üîπ 3. Live PR Feedback Simulation (Behavioral + Technical Review) Prompt: A junior engineer on your team has submitted a PR. You must:
Review the code
Leave constructive feedback
Approve, request changes, or reject
Use a tone that is both assertive and supportive
Why this matters: Tests judgment, mentorship, code review skills, and tone.
üîπ 4. AI Collaboration (LLM Co-Pilot Scenario) Prompt: You're using an internal AI tool to generate a DB migration script. The output is buggy. Your Task:
Prompt it to improve the script
Validate the updated result
Finalize and submit the migration
Why this matters: Tests ability to collaborate with LLMs, prompt engineering, and critical evaluation ‚Äî unique to SkillSim.
üîπ 5. Retrospective Reflection (Self-Awareness Check) Prompt: Looking back on this sprint day, what is one thing you would improve in your workflow or collaboration?
Why this matters: Measures reflection, maturity, and growth mindset.

Competitive Landscape: Why SkillSim Wins
DevSkiller:
Offers project-based coding assessments with RealLifeTesting‚Ñ¢, yet scenarios are limited to predefined templates and static work.
Emphasizes code correctness but lacks context from actual company workflows.
SkillSim Advantage:
AI-native simulations built directly from client Slack threads, Jira tickets, and PRs.
Multimodal testing environment with mock Slack, Jira, IDEs, and logs ‚Äî no other platform offers this.
Simulates the full range of job-relevant activities: async communication, debugging vague specs, writing and responding to tickets.
Soft skill tracking: initiative, reasoning clarity, and collaboration all analyzed using LLM markers.
Vervoe:
Offers simulation-style tests, but relies on generic templates.
Assessment builder is static and manual.
Soft-skill scoring exists but lacks context-specific alignment.
SkillSim Advantage:
Dynamically generates company-specific simulations using RAG + live data.
Tracks how candidates perform across ambiguous, collaborative, and context-rich tasks.
Every test is a tailored job preview, not a general puzzle.
Canditech:
Offers a wide range of formats (coding, spreadsheets, video, logic).

Karat:
Human-led interviews provide depth.
Costly and hard to scale.
Interviewers still operate abstracted from real company tools/data.

Rooted in your code, tickets, and team habits.
CodeSignal / HackerRank:
Efficient for top-of-funnel.
